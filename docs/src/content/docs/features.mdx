The Starlight Code Block Fullscreen plugin enhances your documentation experience by providing fullscreen functionality for code blocks. 

:::note
Once installed, the plugin **will automatically** add a fullscreen **toggle button** to your Expressive Code blocks. Users can:

- Click the fullscreen button to expand code blocks to fullscreen view,
- Use the Escape key to exit fullscreen mode (configurable),
- Or use the browser back button to exit fullscreen mode (configurable).

## Fullscreen Mode
---
Transform any code block into a distraction-free fullscreen view with a single click. The fullscreen mode provides:

- **Enhanced readability**: Code blocks expand to fill the entire screen,
- **Dark overlay**: Minimizes distractions with a semi-transparent background,
- **Optimized zoom**: Automatically applies configurable zoom levels for better code visibility.


```javascript title="Example Code Block"
// This code block will have a fullscreen button
function greetUser(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  return `Welcome to the documentation`;
}
```

## Usage Examples
---

### Basic Navigation
1. **Focus a code block**: Use TAB to navigate to any code block on the page,
2. **Enter fullscreen**: Press Enter or click the fullscreen button,
3. **Navigate in fullscreen**: Use TAB to move through the code content,
4. **Exit fullscreen**: Press Escape, use the back button, or click the exit button.

### Multi-Block Navigation
1. **Cycle through blocks**: Use TAB to move between different code blocks,
2. **Quick activation**: Press Enter on any focused code block to enter fullscreen,
3. **Seamless switching**: Exit one block and immediately navigate to another.

## State Management

The plugin provides advanced state management to ensure a reliable user experience:

- **Session persistence**: Remembers user preferences during the session using localStorage
- **Scroll position**: Automatically saves and restores scroll position when exiting fullscreen
- **Intelligent zoom management**: Detects and stores initial browser zoom levels, applies configured fullscreen zoom, and restores original zoom when exiting
- **History integration**: Proper browser history management for back button support
- **Focus state management**: Maintains focus context and provides proper focus restoration for accessibility


## ⌨️ Keyboard Navigation

The plugin provides comprehensive keyboard support for enhanced accessibility and user experience:

### Fullscreen Controls

- **Escape key**: Quickly exit fullscreen mode (configurable),
- **Browser back button**: Use your browser's back button to exit fullscreen (configurable),
- **Tab navigation**: Full keyboard navigation support within fullscreen mode.

### Code Block Cycling

Navigate between multiple code blocks on the same page using keyboard shortcuts:

- **TAB Key**: Cycle forward through all code blocks with fullscreen buttons on the current page,
- **Enter Key**: Activate the fullscreen mode for the currently focused code block,
- **Shift + TAB**: Cycle backward through code blocks (standard browser behavior).

This feature is particularly useful when you have multiple code examples and want to quickly navigate between them without using the mouse.

## Customizable Icons

Personalize the fullscreen experience with custom SVG icons:

- **Enter fullscreen icon**: Customize the icon displayed when not in fullscreen mode,  
- **Exit fullscreen icon**: Customize the icon displayed when in fullscreen mode,
- **SVG path support**: Use any valid SVG path for complete design flexibility,
- **Consistent styling**: Icons automatically inherit your Starlight site's color scheme.

## Button Placement

- **Titled blocks only**: Add buttons only to code blocks with titles (default)
- **All blocks**: Include untitled code blocks with the `addToUntitledBlocks` option

## Smooth Animations

Enhance the user experience with polished animations and transitions:

- **Configurable duration**: Adjust animation speed with values between 150-700ms (default: 200ms),
- **Automatic validation**: Invalid duration values are automatically corrected to ensure optimal performance.
