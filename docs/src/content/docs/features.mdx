The Starlight Code Block Fullscreen plugin enhances your documentation experience by providing powerful fullscreen functionality for code blocks. Here's a comprehensive overview of all the features available.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Navigation
1. **Focus a code block**: Use TAB to navigate to any code block on the page,
2. **Enter fullscreen**: Press Enter or click the fullscreen button,
3. **Navigate in fullscreen**: Use TAB to move through the code content,
4. **Exit fullscreen**: Press Escape, use the back button, or click the exit button.

### Multi-Block Navigation
1. **Cycle through blocks**: Use TAB to move between different code blocks,
2. **Quick activation**: Press Enter on any focused code block to enter fullscreen,
3. **Seamless switching**: Exit one block and immediately navigate to another.

## Fullscreen Mode

Transform any code block into a distraction-free fullscreen view with a single click. The fullscreen mode provides:

- **Enhanced Readability**: Code blocks expand to fill the entire screen,
- **Dark Overlay**: Minimizes distractions with a semi-transparent background,
- **Optimized Zoom**: Automatically applies configurable zoom levels for better code visibility,
- **Smooth Transitions**: Elegant animations when entering and exiting fullscreen mode.

```javascript title="Example Code Block"
// This code block will have a fullscreen button
function greetUser(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  return `Welcome to the documentation`;
}
```

## ⌨️ Keyboard Navigation

The plugin provides comprehensive keyboard support for enhanced accessibility and user experience:

### Fullscreen Controls

- **Escape Key**: Quickly exit fullscreen mode (configurable),
- **Browser Back Button**: Use your browser's back button to exit fullscreen (configurable),
- **Tab Navigation**: Full keyboard navigation support within fullscreen mode.

### Code Block Cycling

Navigate between multiple code blocks on the same page using keyboard shortcuts:

- **TAB Key**: Cycle forward through all code blocks with fullscreen buttons on the current page,
- **Enter Key**: Activate the fullscreen mode for the currently focused code block,
- **Shift + TAB**: Cycle backward through code blocks (standard browser behavior).

This feature is particularly useful when you have multiple code examples and want to quickly navigate between them without using the mouse.

## Customizable Icons

Personalize the fullscreen experience with custom SVG icons:

- **Enter Fullscreen Icon**: Customize the icon displayed when not in fullscreen mode,  
- **Exit Fullscreen Icon**: Customize the icon displayed when in fullscreen mode,
- **SVG Path Support**: Use any valid SVG path for complete design flexibility,
- **Consistent Styling**: Icons automatically inherit your site's color scheme.

## Button Placement

- **Titled Blocks Only**: Add buttons only to code blocks with titles (default),
- **All Blocks**: Include frameless code blocks with the `addToFramelessBlocks` option.

## Smooth Animations

Enhance the user experience with polished animations and transitions:

- **Configurable Duration**: Adjust animation speed from instant to slow transitions.

## State Management

Robust state management ensures a reliable user experience:

- **Session Persistence**: Remembers user preferences during the session,
- **Scroll Position**: Automatically saves and restores scroll position,
- **Zoom State**: Manages zoom levels independently for each code block,
- **History Integration**: Proper browser history management for back button support.
